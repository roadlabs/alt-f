#summary How to break RAID 1 without losing data

{{{

If for whatever reason you wish to stop using RAID1, you already have valuable data on it
and don't want to loose it, and you haven't flashed Alt-F (you are running it "on-top" of
the vendor's firmware, using the "reloaded" mode), then you can follow the procedure bellow,
contributed by John L.

If however you have flashed Alt-F, you can just use the RAID web page and, with a running array,
select Operations->Destroy(*); you will be left with your data duplicated on each of the
RAID1 components and you can mount and use them using the Disk->Filesystem web page.
(*) - for RC2 you can disregard the warning given in the confirmation dialogue saying that all
data will be lost, as that don't apply to RAID1.

The more complex procedure described bellow by John L. was necessary because there was the need
to guarantee that upon reboot the vendor's firmware would continue recognizing the disks
filesystem and booting Alt-F.

How to break RAID 1 without losing data
=======================================

1.      Backup all you data.
        Although this procedure was tested successfully, one should always prepare for the worst.

2.      Stop all services
        System -> Utilities -> StopAll
        Your web UI will still be accessible
        
3.      Remove one disk out of RAID. Let's suppose you want to remove left first
        Disk -> RAID -> Component -> Remove Left

4.      Clear RAID info from the disk that you just removed
        Disk -> RAID -> Component -> Clear Left
        
5.      At this point, left disk becomes a standalone disk. File system on it should be mounted
        automatically and accessible. Or you can mount it manually. You can/should do a
        compare between this new fs and md0(the degraded RAID) to make sure the left disk
        contains all the data.
        
6.      Eject Left disk
        Disk -> Utilities -> Eject
        
        Alternatively, you can choose to shutdown the server and carry next step if you
        are not comfortable with hot un-plug. In my test, hot plug/un-plug worked very well.
        
7.      Physical remove left disk. If you have shutdown the unit, power it back up, it
        will start on right disk as degraded RAID 1
        
        Step 6 and 7 is done as precaution measure. Left disk can serve as an offline backup
        in case the unit doesn't boot up once RAID is broken

8.      Destroy RAID
        Disk -> RAID -> Destroy
        
9.      Right disk becomes a standalone disk, fs on it should be mounted and accessible

10.     [Optional, but strongly recommended]Reboot the unit to make sure it can boot from
        single right disk and contents are accessible
        
11.     Plug back left disk,  ALT-F should just recognizes it and mount it.
        Again, as mentioned in step 6, if you are not comfortable about hot plug, you can
        shutdown the unit and plug
        
That's it! It's actually surprisingly easy. You don't even need to reboot the unit
in the whole process if you choose to.
This procedure is tested on 01RC2 running on top of stock firmware 1.09.
Same procedure should be more reliable if you already flashed Alt-F.
